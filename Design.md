## Description
For this project, I basically used a template from BootStrap and took with many customizations. Basically, I changed all introduction, all photos, and all links to fit my personal infomation. Then, I add two second pages and changed the structure of some sections. Finally, I added a JS timer on the left corner of head section.

The project consists of several sections divided by each topic, including home, hobbies, projects, skills, courses, contact. Each section are in different colors with its neighbor so it's easy to distinguish. On the left corner of head, there is a JS timer. That is my js implementation. On the projects section, I set 2 buttons, coordinating to 2 projects. Each will redirect to its own second page. Last, I added my contact infomation with several social medias like facebook, twitter, and linkedin.
